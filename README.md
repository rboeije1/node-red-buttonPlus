# node-red-buttonPlus
Based on node-red flow of @balk77 (https://github.com/balk77/node-red-buttonplus-menu/tree/buttons-mqtt-update)

Temporary version (so far) of the 223-1-2024 version of this flow of Balk, with the following additions:
- Some help in comment balloons added
- Disable the 'config' branch in the constructed JSON-file
- Added some debug to outputs to illustrate usage
- Removed some Home Assistant items.

While this version can be used in the same way as the original file bij Balk77, it is even more work in progress.
